    "### Goals\n",
    "This is a hitchhiker's guide to score-based generative models, a family of approaches based on [estimating gradients of the data distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600). They have obtained high-quality samples comparable to GANs (like below, figure from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09011)) without requiring adversarial training, and are considered by some to be [the new contender to GANs](https://ajolicoeur.wordpress.com/the-new-contender-to-gans-score-matching-with-langevin-sampling/).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Score and Score-Based Models\n",
    "Given a probablity density function $p(\\mathbf{x})$, we define the *score* as $$\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p(\\mathbf{x}).$$ As you might guess, score-based generative models are trained to estimate $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p(\\mathbf{x})$. Unlike likelihood-based models such as flow models or autoregressive models, score-based models do not have to be normalized and are easier to parameterize. For example, consider a non-normalized statistical model $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{e^{-E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})}}{Z_\\theta}$, where $E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is called the energy function and $Z_\\theta$ is an unknown normalizing constant that makes $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})$ a proper probability density function. The energy function is typically parameterized by a flexible neural network. When training it as a likelihood model, we need to know the normalizing constant $Z_\\theta$ by computing complex high-dimensional integrals, which is typically intractable. In constrast, when computing its score, we obtain $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})$ which does not require computing the normalizing constant $Z_\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, any neural network that maps an input vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ to an output vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ can be used as a score-based model, as long as the output and input have the same dimensionality. This yields huge flexibility in choosing model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perturbing Data with a Diffusion Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to generate samples with score-based models, we need to consider a [diffusion process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process) that corrupts data slowly into random noise. Scores will arise when we reverse this diffusion process for sample generation. You will see this later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "A diffusion process is a [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process#:~:text=A%20stochastic%20or%20random%20process%20can%20be%20defined%20as%20a,an%20element%20in%20the%20set.) similar to [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion). Their paths are like the trajectory of a particle submerged in a flowing fluid, which moves randomly due to unpredictable collisions with other particles. Let $\\{\\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\}_{t=0}^T$ be a diffusion process, indexed by the continuous time variable $t\\in [0,T]$. A diffusion process is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE), in the following form\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "d \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t) d t + g(t) d \\mathbf{w},\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{f}(\\cdot, t): \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ is called the *drift coefficient* of the SDE, $g(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is called the *diffusion coefficient*, and $\\mathbf{w}$ represents the standard Brownian motion. You can understand an SDE as a stochastic generalization to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Particles moving according to an SDE not only follows the deterministic drift $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, but are also affected by the random noise coming from $g(t) d\\mathbf{w}$. From now on, we use $p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ to denote the distribution of $\\mathbf{x}(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For score-based generative modeling, we will choose a diffusion process such that $\\mathbf{x}(0) \\sim p_0$, and $\\mathbf{x}(T) \\sim p_T$. Here $p_0$ is the data distribution where we have a dataset of i.i.d. samples, and $p_T$ is the prior distribution that has a tractable form and easy to sample from. The noise perturbation by the diffusion process is large enough to ensure $p_T$ does not depend on $p_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reversing the Diffusion Process Yields Score-Based Generative Models\n",
    "By starting from a sample from the prior distribution $p_T$ and reversing the diffusion process, we will be able to obtain a sample from the data distribution $p_0$. Crucially, the reverse process is a diffusion process running backwards in time. It is given by the following reverse-time SDE\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  d\\mathbf{x} = [\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t) - g^2(t)\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})] dt + g(t) d\\bar{\\mathbf{w}},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{\\mathbf{w}}$ is a Brownian motion in the reverse time direction, and $dt$ represents an infinitesimal negative time step. This reverse SDE can be computed once we know the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward SDE, as well as the score of $p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ for each $t\\in[0, T]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall intuition of score-based generative modeling with SDEs can be summarized in the illustration below\n",
    "\n",
    "![sde schematic](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ptvb790eQRYMHLnDGBeYZK9A2cF-JMEP)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Score Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above intuition, we can use the time-dependent score function $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ to construct the reverse-time SDE, and then solve it numerically to obtain samples from $p_0$ using samples from a prior distribution $p_T$. We can train a time-dependent score-based model $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ to approximate $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$, using the following weighted sum of [denoising score matching](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/Publications/smdae_techreport.pdf) objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\min_\\theta \\mathbb{E}_{t\\sim \\mathcal{U}(0, T)} [\\lambda(t) \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}(0) \\sim p_0(\\mathbf{x})}\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{x}(t) \\sim p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))}[ \\|s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}(t), t) - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}(t)}\\log p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))\\|_2^2]],\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{U}(0,T)$ is a uniform distribution over $[0, T]$, $p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))$ denotes the transition probability from $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ to $\\mathbf{x}(t)$, and $\\lambda(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ denotes a positive weighting function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the objective, the expectation over $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ can be estimated with empirical means over data samples from $p_0$. The expectation over $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ can be estimated by sampling from $p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))$, which is efficient when the drift coefficient $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is affine. The weight function $\\lambda(t)$ is typically chosen to be inverse proportional to $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\log p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0)) \\|_2^2]$.\n",

    "### Time-Dependent Score-Based Model\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no restrictions on the network architecture of time-dependent score-based models, except that their output should have the same dimensionality as the input, and they should be conditioned on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several useful tips on architecture choice:\n",
    "* It usually performs well to use the [U-net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) architecture as the backbone of the score network $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can incorporate the time information via [Gaussian random features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10739). Specifically, we first sample $\\omega \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, s^2\\mathbf{I})$ which is subsequently fixed for the model (i.e., not learnable). For a time step $t$, the corresponding Gaussian random feature is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  [\\sin(2\\pi \\omega t) ; \\cos(2\\pi \\omega t)],\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $[\\vec{a} ; \\vec{b}]$ denotes the concatenation of vector $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$. This Gaussian random feature can be used as an encoding for time step $t$ so that the score network can condition on $t$ by incorporating this encoding. We will see this further in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can rescale the output of the U-net by $1/\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\log p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0)) \\|_2^2]}$. This is because the optimal $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}(t), t)$ has an $\\ell_2$-norm close to $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\log p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))]\\|_2$, and the rescaling helps capture the norm of the true score. Recall that the training objective contains sums of the form\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbf{x}(t) \\sim p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))}[ \\|s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}(t), t) - \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}(t)}\\log p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))\\|_2^2].\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Therefore, it is natural to expect that the optimal score model $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}(t)} \\log p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use [exponential moving average](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/how-to-apply-exponential-moving-average-decay-for-variables/10856/3) (EMA) of weights when sampling. This can greatly improve sample quality, but requires slightly longer training time, and requires more work in implementation. We do not include this in this tutorial, but highly recommend it when you employ score-based generative modeling to tackle more challenging real problems."

Therefore, given $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$, we can get an approximate sample from $p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ by running several steps of Langevin MCMC, replacing $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ with $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in the iteration rule.\n",

    "Predictor-Corrector samplers combine both numerical solvers for the reverse-time SDE and the Langevin MCMC approach. In particular, we first apply one step of numerical SDE solver to obtain $\\mathbf{x}_{t-\\Delta t}$ from $\\mathbf{x}_t$, which is called the \"predictor\" step. Next, we apply several steps of Langevin MCMC to refine $\\mathbf{x}_t$, such that $\\mathbf{x}_t$ becomes a more accurate sample from $p_{t-\\Delta t}(\\mathbf{x})$. This is the \"corrector\" step as the MCMC helps reduce the error of the numerical SDE solver."

    "## Likelihood Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "A by-product of the probability flow ODE formulation is likelihood computation. Suppose we have a differentiable one-to-one mapping $\\mathbf{h}$ that transforms a data sample $\\mathbf{x} \\sim p_0$ to a prior distribution $\\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{x}) \\sim p_T$. We can compute the likelihood of $p_0(\\mathbf{x})$ via the following [change-of-variable formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function#Function_of_random_variables_and_change_of_variables_in_the_probability_density_function)\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "p_0(\\mathbf{x}) = p_T(\\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{x})) |\\operatorname{det}(J_\\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{x}))|,\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $J_\\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{x})$ represents the Jacobian of the mapping $\\mathbf{h}$, and we assume it is efficient to evaluate the likelihood of the prior distribution $p_T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trajectories of an ODE also define a one-to-one mapping from $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ to $\\mathbf{x}(T)$. For ODEs of the form\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "d \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t) dt,\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "there exists an [instantaneous change-of-variable formula](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) that connects the probability of $p_0(\\mathbf{x})$ and $p_1(\\mathbf{x})$, given by\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "p_0 (\\mathbf{x}(0)) = e^{\\int_0^1 \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}(t), t) d t} p_1(\\mathbf{x}(1)),\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $\\operatorname{div}$ denotes the divergence function (trace of Jacobian).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this divergence function can be hard to evaluate for general vector-valued function $\\mathbf{f}$, but we can use an unbiased estimator, named [Skilling-Hutchinson estimator](http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/09/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-3-hutchinsons-trick/), to approximate the trace. Let $\\boldsymbol \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})$. The Skilling-Hutchinson estimator is based on the fact that\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})}[\\boldsymbol\\epsilon^\\intercal  J_\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}) \\boldsymbol\\epsilon].\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Therefore, we can simply sample a random vector $\\boldsymbol \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})$, and then use $\\boldsymbol \\epsilon^\\intercal J_\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}) \\boldsymbol \\epsilon$ to estimate the divergence of $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$. This estimator only requires computing the Jacobian-vector product $J_\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\boldsymbol \\epsilon$, which is typically efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, for our probability flow ODE, we can compute the (log) data likelihood with the following\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\log p_0(\\mathbf{x}(0)) = \\log p_1(\\mathbf{x}(1)) -\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 \\frac{d[\\sigma^2(t)]}{dt} \\operatorname{div} s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}(t), t) dt.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "With the Skilling-Hutchinson estimator, we can compute the divergence via\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\operatorname{div} s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}(t), t) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})}[\\boldsymbol\\epsilon^\\intercal  J_{s_\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}(t), t) \\boldsymbol\\epsilon].\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Afterwards, we can compute the integral with numerical integrators. This gives us an unbiased estimate to the true data likelihood, and we can make it more and more accurate when we run it multiple times and take the average. The numerical integrator requires $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ as a function of $t$, which can be obtained by the probability flow ODE sampler."
